            <h2>My Hobbies:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cars<p>I enjoy driving cars alot, I first started being interested in cars when I was younger, with my dad taking me to car shows and explaining all the different types, then pointing out the different types of cars I would see on the road. </p></li>
                <li>video games <p>Ive always taken an interest in video games ever since I was a kid, with my brother showing me new games and playing online with friends always proving to be a good time.</p></li>
                <li>Movies <p>I personally enjoy watching movies more than shows because they show the entire story in a shorter span of time, and also bring back childhood memmories of going to the movie theater and getting popcorn.</p></li>
                <li>flying<p>Flying may seem like an odd choice but since my father is an aircraft mechanic and always surrounded by planes, its hard not to like them, but being sealed in a plane is not as fun as an ultralight flight, with no cabin and no windshield its a lot more refreshing.</p></li>
                <li>computers<p>Computer hardware has always been an intrest for me, with the components that rely on eachother in-order to properly work, with even a single error the whole system can shutdown, but something about them working in sync brings me joy.</p></li>
                <li>working on cars<p>Ever since I was a kid my dad has always had me help work on his cars, whether it was holding the light or sticking my hands into hard to reach places to get the bolt he dropped, although I may not have thought it then, now looking back I see how important it was that I experienced it. </p></li>

            <h2>Image hover effects in CSS</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Image hover effects are effects used to show animation in a website's visuals, they make the site more interesting and interactive allowing the viewer to have more fun and spend more time on the site.</p>

                <p>Hover effects can take many forms, such as buttons and links but the most creative form is image hovers, while hovering over an image you can make it take many forms, Image hover effects are a way to spice up your images and make your website feel more fun and hi-tech. Some simple hover effects could include Grayscale to Color, fade in images, growing animations, shrinking animations, square images to circle images, a 3D shadow effect, adding a border around our images, blurring the image, we can even change the orientation of the image by rotating it, we can even brighten up an image upon hover.</p>

                <p>All these effects can be done with some simple coding and can have a large impact on the outlook of your website. Adding hover effects into your website makes it easier for the reader to know where to click. There are many places to find these animations pre-made, probably locked behind a paywall to access them, but it can be a useful tool for those needing animations. Hover effects have a high payoff when implemented with a low cost of effort, which is mainly the reason behind them being one of the most used effects on websites.</p>

                <p>If you want to, try going to a popular website or one of your choosing and look out for hover effects, Im sure it won't take long to identify one if not multiple. Another example of this is in news articles that often advertise subscriptions, for example when you access a site and try to leave there is a pop-up that tries to get you to subscribe to their service. Interactions between the user and the website is a very important part of any site, keeping users engaged and encouraging them to spend more time exploring and pressing buttons.</p>

                <p>The image hover effect I wanted to focus on was a way to display the text while hovering over a photo, since in this project we have descriptions under each photo, instead of a simple zoom-in or tilt, so the method I used was to shift the figure caption up by -100%, this moves the figure captions out of the hidden view and into view. If you were to mess with the translation percentage and set it to a higher percentage, it is possible that the figure caption could be displayed prior to hovering over the image.</p>

                <p>Another form of hover effect that I was attempting to use was to hover over and darken the image and display text, but this required the use of divs, but this doesn't work well with the way I chose to display the gallery, and would often break the structure of the gallery section, so I had to abort that idea and move onto another version that could be easily implemented into the structure of my code. An example of this is shown above in the gallery section, displaying how after hovering over each image the text is shown. </p>
