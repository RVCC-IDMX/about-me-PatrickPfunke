            <div>
                <p>"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he
                    passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was
                    William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr.
                    McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.
                    McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm.
                    To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following
                    him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had
                    occurred.</p>

                <p>"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of
                    them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
                    edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe
                    Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw,
                    at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to
                    be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son,
                    and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
                    violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two
                    McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She
                    had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had
                    found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited,
                    without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with
                    fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool.
                    The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such
                    as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on
                    the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly
                    arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on
                    Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes.
                    Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."</p>

                <p>"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to
                    a criminal it does so here."</p>

                <p>"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point
                    very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it
                    pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed,
                    however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that
                    he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them
                    Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have
                    retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the
                    case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is
                    that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
                    digesting their breakfasts at home."</p>

                <p>"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained
                    out of this case."</p>

                <p>"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may
                    chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade.
                    You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy
                    his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the
                    first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the
                    right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a
                    thing as that."</p>
