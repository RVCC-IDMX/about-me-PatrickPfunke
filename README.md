 - This projects purpose is to demonstrate to concepts we have learn throughout the course of IDMX-225 at RVCC, From creating avatars and using svgs to creating unordered lists to display information and inputing our own personal videos and photos. We created a photo gallery to show some of our favorite photos, we implemented a large text area for a topic of interest to be shared, and also a contact form that actually works! we used a hamburger menu to be able to efficiently display the sections in a clean manner. 
 - The color scheme I used was was a light blue background (#ACC8E5), and a dark red text color (#350000) This has a contrast ratio of 10.55:1.
